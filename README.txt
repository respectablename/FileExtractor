The primary purpose of this file is to download the files that are associated in SLACK extract .json files. 
This is mainly if you are using the free 10K version. If you export you only get the conversations, and not the files / images. This script will then read those daily .json files and pull all the files down with a unique name. You can run it multiple times and it will not download the same file twice.
